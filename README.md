# Prerelease Branch

Welcome to the `prerelease` branch! Here you'll find the updates that are still being worked on and aren't fully final.

All code here should work fine although may have aesthetic, code refactoring or functional changes prior to release. Mostly to keep everything consistent and design the Script Launcher in a way that satisfies the most people possible.

Pull requests are only accepted on this branch although may be later merged upstream into the `stable` branch once modified to fit with the rest of the Script Launcher.

# Pull Request Guide

Should you want to commit code changes (thank you for that!) please ensure the following:

  - Code formatting is consistent with the rest of the code (whitespace, readability, etc)
  - Colours are consitent with the rest of the Script Launcher (themes don't count)
  ##### That's all I can think of right now, please make a PR if you have better ideas <3

All code here will still be fully exitable/closeable in the extremely unlikely event something does go wrong you can safely destroy the launcher from your Roblox instance.
