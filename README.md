# ScriptLauncher - Prerelease

This is the prerelease branch! Here you'll find the updates that are still being worked on and aren't fully final.

All code here should work fine although may have aesthetic, code refactoring or functional changes prior to release. Mostly to keep everything consistent and design the Script Launcher in a way that satisfies the most people possible.

Pull requests are only accepted on this branch although may be later merged upstream into the stable branch once modified to fit with the rest of the Script Launcher.

## Pull Request Guide

Should you want to commit code changes (thank you for that!) please ensure the following:

  - Code formatting is consistent with the rest of the code (whitespace, readability, etc)
  - Colours are consitent with the rest of the Script Launcher (Themes don't count)
  ##### That's all I can think of right now, please make a PR if you have better ideas <3


## There is a high chance this code may not fully work as intended, any side effects that result in damage to your computer are your responsibility
##### Nothing bad *should* happen but just as a precaution and so my ass is covered lol

##### All code here should still be fully exitable/closeable so if something does go wrong you can safely destroy the launcher from your Roblox instance
