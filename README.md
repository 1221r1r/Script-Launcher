# RooRay's Script Launcher

###### This currently doesn't work and is in the process of being rewritten, please do not submit any GitHub issues regarding it not working while I fix it! 
###### The rewritten code will rely on the Synapse X Filesystem API for configuration, please ensure you use an executor that is compatible! (Synapse X is recommended)

## Pull Requests to this branch are not accepted, please make Pull Requests for code changes in the `prerelease` branch instead!

This is an exploit script launcher (sometimes called a "Script Hub") for Roblox! The code is completely open (as it uses a lot of scripts from other people) and is completely unobfuscated/unencrypted etc.

If there's any scripts you want added, feel free to send me a DM on the linked twitter on my GitHub profile or on Discord (`RooRay#0001`)!

# Installation

## Recommended (ensures you always have the latest version)

In your executor of choice's code editor, paste the loadstring (`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooRay/Script-Launcher/stable/src/main.lua"))();`) and execute/run it!

## Alternative method (requires you to manually replace the code when there's an update)

Paste the contents of the `main.lua` ([AKA this](https://github.com/RooRay/Script-Launcher/blob/stable/src/main.lua)) file in this repository into your executor of choice's editor and execute/run it!
