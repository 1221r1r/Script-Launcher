# Script-Launcher - Prerelease

This is the prerelease branch! Here you'll find the updates that are still being worked on and aren't fully final.

All code here should work fine although may have aesthetic, code-related or functional changes prior to release. Mostly to gauge feedback and see what scripts and UI elements people like and don't like.

Pull requests are only accepted on this branch although may be later merged upstream into the stable branch once modified to fit with the rest of the Script Launcher.
