# Script-Launcher

Hi! This is an exploit script launcher for Roblox! The code is completely open (as it uses a lot of scripts from other people) and is unobfuscated/unencrypted etc.
While this should work with any executor compatible with Roblox I've only tested it with Synapse X so I'd recommend you use that.

If there's any scripts you want added, feel free to shoot me a DM on the linked twitter on my GitHub profile! Pull requests will also be considered.

# Installation

Installation is pretty easy, either use the loadstring `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooRay/Script-Launcher/main/main.lua"))();` or just copy-paste the code from the main.lua file!
